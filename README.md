# Weight vs. Height Regression Experiments

Simple Jupyter notebooks exploring linear-regression models that predict body weight from height using the classic weight-height dataset. The workflow splits the raw CSV into male and female subsets, then trains separate models for each cohort with basic scaling and metric tracking.

## Project Layout

```
edafe.ipynb                 # Data exploration + gender split
male-model-train.ipynb      # Male-only regression experiment
female-model-train.ipynb    # Female-only regression experiment
weight-height.csv           # Raw dataset
weight-height-*.csv         # Gender-specific subsets generated by edafe.ipynb
myenv/                      # Local virtual environment (Python 3.12)
```

## Getting Started

1. **Create/activate the virtual environment** (optional if `myenv/` already exists):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv myenv
   & .\myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
2. **Install dependencies** (once):
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # if you export one
   ```
   The notebooks currently rely on `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, and `scikit-learn`.
3. **Launch Jupyter**:
   ```powershell
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Open any of the notebooks from the Jupyter UI and run the cells sequentially.

## Notebook Guide

- `edafe.ipynb` cleans the combined dataset, produces quick EDA plots, and exports male/female CSV slices used downstream.
- `male-model-train.ipynb` and `female-model-train.ipynb` follow the same pattern:
  - train/test split on height-only features
  - `StandardScaler` fit on the training split
  - `LinearRegression` fit + basic scatter plots
  - metrics: R², MAE, RMSE (RMSE stays in pounds, so it is easier to interpret than raw MSE)

## Troubleshooting Notes

- Extremely negative R² usually means the scaler was re-fit on the test data; use a `Pipeline` or keep a single `StandardScaler` instance per dataset and `fit` it only on training rows.
- Gradient lines on the scatter plots can look jagged if `X_test` is not sorted—sort before plotting if you want a neater line.
- Because MSE is measured in squared pounds, expect values around 10–20 even when MAE is just 3–4 lb.

## Next Steps

- Add a `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml` so others can reproduce the environment quickly.
- Consider richer feature sets (e.g., polynomial height terms) or models (ridge/lasso) to compare performance.
- Log metrics to disk so you can track improvements over time.
